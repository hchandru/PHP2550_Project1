### Objective

The main objective of this exploratory data analysis is to determine the presence of any associations between exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and child outcomes related to substance use, self-regulation, internalizing problems (IP), externalizing problems (EP), attention problems (AP), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

### Data

The data was collected from a subset of 100 mothers who participated in a previous randomized controlled trial aimed at reducing SDP and ETS using a tailored video intervention, and their children, as part of Dr. Lauren Micalizzi's research on prenatal tobacco exposure and child outcomes at the Brown University School of Public Health. 

There are 49 observations of 78 variables in this data set. Each observation corresponds to a particular parent-child pair and the variables contain information on demographics, on exposure, and on outcomes in children collected from both parents and the children. The data also contains information on outcomes in the parents, but these are not of interest in our current study.

#### Variables

The variables included in this analysis include those on:

-   Parent demographics (race, age, sex, number of languages spoken, employment, highest level of education and annual household income),
-   Child demographics (race, age, sex, number of languages spoken),
-   Exposure to SDP (self-reported information from the parent about whether they smoked when 16 weeks, 22 weeks and 32 weeks pregnant and urine cotinine (UC) levels from parent at 34 weeks pregnant)
-   Exposure to ETS (self-reported information on whether the parent or partner smoked during the first 5 years of the child's life, on whether the parent smoked at the first and second postpartum visits, and at 12 weeks and 6 months postpartum, and urine cotinine levels from both mom and baby at 6 months postpartum)
-   Substance use in child (if cigarettes, e-cigarettes/vape, marijuana, or alcohol were ever used and if so, how frequently in the last 30 days),
-   Internalizing, attention and externalizing problems in child (self-reported and parent-reported scores on the Brief Problem Monitor),
-   Self-regulation in child (self-reported average cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES) scores on the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire),
-   ADHD in child (SWAN scores on the inattentive and hyperactive items),
-   ASD in child (absence, presence or suspicion)
